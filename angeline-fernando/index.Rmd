I have two major research interests. My primary interest is digital marketing, specifically in understanding online consumer behaviour and using analytics to gain consumer intelligence from social media.My secondary interest is motivated by the attitude-behaviour gap in environmentally-conscious consumer behaviour. I develop practical solutions to encourage this behaviour. Most of my research questions are therefore framed in these two contexts and I investigate the answer to these questions using experimental, cross-sectional and qualitative research.
